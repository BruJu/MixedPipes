[Play the game on Github Pages: https://bruju.github.io/MixedPipes/](https://bruju.github.io/MixedPipes/)

"Oh yeah that game".

This is yet of another (I couldn't find the real name of this game where you have to connect a network of pipes) clone.


## Getting started

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`


## How to play

- Left click lets the user spin a tile
- Right click locks it
- ZQSD / WASD lets the user move in the grid if it is in broken wall mode
- Pressing C colors the grid in such a way that connected tiles are in the same color. Pressing C again desactivates this mode
- Pressing M tries to solve the grid for you.
